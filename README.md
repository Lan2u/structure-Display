# chemistry.Structure-Display
A program for displaying the structure of a compounds given it's AXnEn


**AXnEn** 
A = Central Atom always A
Xn = X followed by the number of donated electron pairs from ligands (X1, X2 ,X3 etc.)
        n is any integer >= 1 
En = E followed by the number of lone electron pairs on the central atom A (E0,E1,E2,E3...)
        n is any integer >= 0
